I've been thinking about starting a personal blog around software and the like. I've recently been hanging around in the [golang subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/), and came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - a super-fast static site generator written in go.

This is the start of my blog!

Resources used for setting up the blog

* [Hugo - Host on GitHub](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
* [Creating a Hugo site on GitHub Pages](https://dev.to/dgavlock/creating-a-hugo-site-on-github-pages-3cjo) by Dillon Gavlock
* [GitHub Pages Basics](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)

I'm currently using the awesome [hugo-coder theme](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder).
